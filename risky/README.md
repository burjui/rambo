=====
RISC-V instruction encoding library. The following instruction sets are implemented at the moment:
* RV32I base instruction
* RV32M extension

No 16-bit instructions yet. The library is in its early days, so there is more to come.

The code is based on the official RISC-V documentation:
> “The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume I: User-Level ISA, Document Version 2.2”,
Editors Andrew Waterman and Krste Asanović, RISC-V Foundation, May 2017.
